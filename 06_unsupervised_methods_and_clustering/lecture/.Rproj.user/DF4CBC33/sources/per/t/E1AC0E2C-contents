# Comments

## General
- comments in code starts with # JK:

## read_transform_write

- split data reading and processing into two steps, this improves readability
- I would recommend to include row.names = FALSE in `write.csv` to produce csv file, that is easier to share
- return is not necessary R functions returns last value, and it should be avoided

## plot_histogram

- check for numeric is sufficient, because integer is a subtype of numeric
- split the code into two lines to improve readability - data reading and plotting

# Final assessment

- code is working: 30/30
- code is well written: 13/30 (split data reading and processing,`return`, only `numeric` check)
- code is producing correct results: 40/40 
- total: 73/100 PASSED
