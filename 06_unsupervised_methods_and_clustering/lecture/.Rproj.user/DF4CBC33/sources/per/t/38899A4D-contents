# Comments

## General
- comments in code starts with # JK:
- very good work!
- I would recommend splitting code into multiple chunks to make it more readable
- in general importing libraries should be at the start of chunk, not in the middle of the function
- in general I would recommend to format code to have at maximum 80 chars per line - it will improve reading the code

## read_transform_write

- the `library(dplyr)` is not used in the function, so it can be removed
- the use of `dplyr` does not make any sense since you are not using it in the function
- I appreciate the use of `row.names = FALSE` in write.csv
- your code should return first five rows, your code produces 6
- return is not necessary R functions returns last value, and it should be avoided

## plot_histogram

- you should also check if the column is numeric since we are focusing on producing histogram

# Final assessment

- code is working: 30/30
- code is well written: 23/30 (the space before [, more than 80, `return`)
- code is producing correct results: 30/40 (mistake in `head`, missing check for numeric column in `plot_histogram`)
- total: 83/100 PASSED
